3D Printing

##Past
1. What is 3D printing?

2. How does it work?
	a. compare additive v. subtractive manufacturing
	b. 
	
3. How long has it been around?
	a. historic use in prototyping
	
4. Different methods
	a. FDM
	b. SLA
	c. SLS / DMLS
	d. Z-Corp multicolor
	e. Objet multi-material
	
	
5. Advantages
	a. cheaper for short run production
	b. quicker design cycle by prototyping in-house
	c. ability to generate structures too complex for subtractive manufacuring
	
6. Disadvantages

##Present
1. DIY movement & Open source initiatives
	a. software
	b. hardware
	c. abiltiy to make entirely custom products

2. RepRap / 

3. Software/production chain

4. 

##Future
1. Different types of FDM robotics

2. DIY
